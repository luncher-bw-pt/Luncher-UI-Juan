Lambda Build Week Project: Luncher App

To benefit and support students from lower-income families, this app will help schools in providing one of the most essential parts of a school day.
Lunch.
This site is the marketing page for the app LUNCHER, which will allow schools to set up their financial needs required to provide lunches to students who need them.

The importance of having a lunch in the middle of the school day is understated, school can be tough and very demanding, and children especially need that nutrition and energy to keep them going throughout the day.
